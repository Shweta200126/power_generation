# India Power Generation Infrastructure Analysis using Python & Tableau

## Project Background

India's power generation sector is the backbone of its economic growth, supporting the energy needs of over 1.4 billion people. The country relies on a diverse mix of energy sources including thermal, hydro, nuclear, and an increasing share of renewable sources like solar and wind energy. To achieve its climate goals and meet growing energy demand, India has been scaling up its renewable energy capacity and improving the efficiency of its traditional power plants.

This project focuses on an in-depth analysis of India’s power generation infrastructure from 2018 to 2023. Using over 1.04 million daily power generation reports from the National Power Portal, we analyzed trends in power generation growth, regional performance, and the impact of outages. The insights gained can inform policy decisions, investment strategies, and help optimize energy production for the future.

As of 2024, India’s power sector continues to evolve, and understanding its dynamics is crucial for long-term sustainability and reliability.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the usage patterns of India’s power generation infrastructure using Python and Tableau. By consolidating and analyzing the dataset, we can reveal insights on power generation efficiency, peak production periods, and the performance of different energy sources across states and regions.

## Data

The data consists of daily power generation reports for various sources (thermal, hydro, nuclear, renewable) across India, covering the years from 2018 to 2023. The dataset was obtained from the National Power Portal, and key metrics such as daily power output, plant outages, and regional breakdowns are included. 

The data was pre-processed to remove inconsistencies, missing entries, and duplications to ensure accurate analysis.

## Data Analysis

- **Power Generation Trends**: Analyze the total and source-wise power generation trends over time, identifying seasonal peaks and growth patterns.
  
- **Regional and State-Level Insights**: Identify power generation patterns across regions and states, and compare the performance of different states in generating power from renewable versus traditional sources.
  
- **Power Plant Outages**: Examine the frequency and duration of power plant outages and assess their impact on overall energy production.
  
- **Energy Source Contributions**: Determine the contribution of various sources (thermal, hydro, solar, wind, nuclear) to the overall power generation mix, highlighting the shift toward renewable energy.

## Visualization

Using Tableau, we created a series of interactive dashboards to visualize India’s power generation landscape. These dashboards include:

- **National Overview**: A comprehensive view of power generation trends across India, broken down by energy source and region.
  
- **State-Level Performance**: Maps and bar charts showing the performance of different states in generating power from various sources.
  
- **Energy Source Distribution**: Pie charts and line graphs showcasing the contributions of thermal, hydro, nuclear, and renewable sources over the years.
  
- **Outage Impact**: Visualization of power plant outages and their correlation with dips in energy production at regional and state levels.

## Datasets used in the project

- **National Power Portal**: Daily power generation reports from 2018-2023.  [https://npp.gov.in/publishedReports]() 
- **Regional Weather Data**: To analyze weather patterns that might influence power generation (hydro, solar).  
- **State-Level Economic Data**: For correlating energy production with economic activities.  
- **Grid Data**: Power grid data for analyzing transmission efficiency and losses.

## Conclusion

By analyzing India’s power generation data, we gained valuable insights into the performance of different energy sources and regions. The results provide critical input for decision-making, especially in optimizing the power mix and improving plant efficiency. The interactive Tableau dashboards allow stakeholders to explore the data in detail, offering a powerful tool for policy planning and investment in the power sector.

This project sheds light on India's progress toward cleaner energy and provides a roadmap for future power infrastructure planning.
